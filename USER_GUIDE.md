# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to write and run tests.

## How do I get set up? ##

Prerequisites are:

-  get Vs Code, cypress and cucumber : cf SETUP.md

### Files and folders Organization ###

#### .feature ####
The feature files should be in cypress/integration/ : cypress/integration/POC cucumber/POC1.feature
You can create as many files as you want.

#### .js ####
As you can see below, the organization of folders/files are important, like the names of folders and files

![cucumber](https://bitbucket.org/automationteamaltea/pocvscodecypresscucumber/raw/master/images/organization.png)

For a folder named **POC1.feature** (in the folder POC cucumber), you need a folder **POC1** and inside this folder, the js entry point is a file name **POC1.js** (or any other .js file in the same path)

![cucumber](https://bitbucket.org/automationteamaltea/pocvscodecypresscucumber/raw/master/images/POC1.png)

The js files contain the step definitions for the POC1.feature.

There is a way to create reusable step definitions by putting them in cypress/integration/POC cucumber/common/ : cypress/integration/POC cucumber/common/common.js
Then, inside the main js, add the import : 

```
	import common from '../common/common.js';
```

### How to write a test ###

#### .feature ####
In the feature file, the test is written in Gherkin langage: https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/

Example : POC1.feature
```	  
  Feature: DEMO POC 1

   This feature is created for a demo

   Background:
      Given the google WebSite
      
   @wip
   Scenario: Result is in first position
      When I search for "climaginaire"
      Then the search retrieves "http://www.climaginaire.com/" as results
   
 
   Scenario: There are lots of result
      When I search for "climaginaire"
      Then the page "2" exists
```

**_Feature_**: The first primary keyword in a Gherkin document must always be Feature, followed by a : and a short text that describes the feature. You can add free-form text underneath Feature to add more description.

**_Background_**: Occasionally youâ€™ll find yourself repeating the same Given steps in all of the scenarios in a Feature.

**_Scenario (or Example)_**: This is a concrete example that illustrates a business rule. It consists of a list of steps.
Examples follow this same pattern:
- Describe an initial context (Given steps)
- Describe an event (When steps)
- Describe an expected outcome (Then steps)

**_@wip_**: The tag is used to execute only tagged scenarios in a feature (more explanation below)

#### .features ####
By creating a file All.features, you can execute all tests in all .feature in one time. (more explanation below)
The file is empty, it's alright. 

#### one file .js ####

The js file contains the translation of Gherkins in javascript.
First of all, in all .js files you need to make sure you either require/import the functions defining step definitions :

```
	import { Given, When, Then } from 'cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps';
```

Then each Gherkins sentence has an associated js code :

```
	Given('the google WebSite', () => {
		cy.visit("http://www.google.com/");
	});

	When('I search for {string}', (keyword) => {
		// find search bar, type the keyword and cliek enter
		cy.get('.gLFyf').type(keyword + '{enter}');
	});

	Then('the search retrieves {string} as results', (keyword) => {
		cy.get(':nth-child(1) > .rc > .r > a').then(($response) => {
			cy.get($response).invoke('attr', 'href').then($href => {
			expect($href).to.equal(keyword);
			});
		})
	});

	Then('the page {string} exists', (number) => {
		var count = parseFloat(number)+1;
		cy.get(':nth-child(' + count + ') > .fl').should('be.visible');
	});
```

### How to run a test ###

```run``` : a video is recorded in /cypress/videos
```open``` : no video recorded

#### Run all tests in one .feature ####

To run a Cypress Launcher,
1 - In the terminal window, type : 

```
		./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

2 - In this window, click on POC1.feature, the test is running.

#### Run all features ####
1 - Create a file All.features in cypress/integration/POC cucumber/ : cypress/integration/POC cucumber/All.features.
The file is empty, it's alright.

2 - Modify the cypress.json, the content is : 

```
	{
		"integrationFolder": "cypress/integration",
		"pluginsFile": "cypress/plugins/index.js",
		"testFiles": "**/*.{feature,features}"
	}
```

**First way to run tests** :
3 - In the terminal window, type : 

```
		npm start
```
4 - In this window, click on All.features, all tests includes in POC1.feature and POC2.feature are running.

**Second way to run tests** :
5 - In package.json, add in the object "script" :

```
        "start_all": "./node_modules/.bin/cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/**/*.feature'"
```

6 - In the terminal window, type : 

```
		npm run start_all
```
==>  all tests includes in POC1.feature and POC2.feature are running.

#### Run one test in a feature ####
Usage: when you don't when to run all tests, put the tag @wip on the top of the scenario or the feature you want to run.

1 - In package.json, add in the object "script" :
```
        "start_wip": "./node_modules/.bin/cypress run -e TAGS=@wip --spec 'cypress/integration/**/*.feature'"
```

2 - In the terminal window, type : 

```
		npm run start_wip
```
==>  all tests with @wip tag in POC1.feature and POC2.feature are running.

### Reporting ###
To save the last execution, 
1 - In package.json, add in the object "cypress-cucumber-preprocessor" :
```   
    "cucumberJson": {
      "generate": true,
      "outputFolder": "cypress/cucumber-json",
      "filePrefix": "",
      "fileSuffix": ".cucumber"
    }
```
=> After each execution, files POC1.cucumber.json and POC2.cucumber.json will be created with results

#### Jenkins (Bonus) ####

Prerequisites are:

-  get jenkins installed : https://jenkins.io/download/thank-you-downloading-windows-installer-stable/

In jenkins : 
1 - Go to http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/installed, check :

- NodeJS Plugin

- Cucumber reports

Click on download and restart jenkins

2 - Go to http://localhost:8080/, create a new item :

- name it "pocvscodecypresscucumber"

- select create a new free style project

- In general : check GitHub project and type the git hub url : https://github.com/carolinelavergne/POC_VS/

- In manage code source : check git and type the repository url : https://github.com/carolinelavergne/POC_VS.git (keep */master as branch)

- In build : select shell script and type:

```
	npm install
	npm install cypress --save-dev
	npm run start_all
```
- In action after build : select cucumber reports, click on "advanced" and type in JSON Reports path: cypress/cucumber-json/

- Save

3 - Go to http://localhost:8080/view/all/job/pocvscodecypresscucumber/ and launch a build

4 - Open the build and click on "console output"
=> you can see the build execution with tests :

![cucumber](https://bitbucket.org/automationteamaltea/pocvscodecypresscucumber/raw/master/images/console.png)

4 - Open the build and click on "Cucumber Report"
=> you can see a visual report :
